# 50.005 Problem Sets
{: .no_toc}

These exercises are designed to **deepen** your understanding of core Operating Systems, Network, and Network Security concepts, <span class="orange-bold">not by repetition or memorization</span>, but through **applied reasoning**, **exploration**, and **curiosity**. They are not your typical practice exam questions, and often go beyond what is directly covered in class, challenging you to think like a system designer or OS detective. 

Some questions may seem open-ended or difficult at first. That’s intentional. Try them with curiosity, not pressure. Use them to **connect ideas**, **test your assumptions**, and develop a more **intuitive** grasp of how computer systems actually work.

If you are looking for a straightforward practice questions, consult:
1. Class Activities
2. Exercises embedded in the notes itself 
3. Regular Quizzes 
4. Wooclap questions (if any)
5. Exercise questions from the official textbooks
