# Python Cryptography
{:.no_toc}


In NS Module 3, we examined how the security properties of <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>confidentiality</b></span> and data <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>integrity</b></span> could be protected by using symmetric key cryptography and signed message digests. In this lab exercise, you will learn how to write a program that makes use of <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>3DES</b></span> for data encryption, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>SHA256</b></span> for creating message digests and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>RSA</b></span> for digital signing.

At the end of this lab exercise, you should be able to:

- Understand how symmetric key cryptography can be used to encrypt data and protect its confidentiality.
- Understand how _multiple_ blocks of data are handled using different block cipher modes and padding.
- Compare the different block cipher modes in terms of how they operate.
- Understand how hash functions can be used to create fixed-length message digests.
- Understand how public key cryptography (e.g., RSA algorithm) can be used to create digital signatures.
- Understand how to create message digest using hash functions (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, etc) and sign it using RSA to guarantee data integrity.

There are 3 parts of this lab:

1. Symmetric key encryption for a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>text</b></span> file
2. Symmetric key encryption for an <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>image</b></span> file
3. Signed message <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>digests</b></span>

## System Requirements

The starter code provided to you is written in Python. You need at least <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Python 3.10</b></span> to complete this assignment and the [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) module. We will use the Python `cryptography` module to write our program instead of implementing 3DES, RSA and SHA-256 directly. You will also need this module for your Programming Assignment 2, so take this lab as a precursor to the asssignment.

While you can develop in Python using any OS, this lab is tested to run on a <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>POSIX-compliant OS</b></span> (path, etc is resolved) so it is not guaranteed that it will run on other OS. You need to f<span class="orange-bold">ix OS-specific problems in the starter code by yourself</span>.
{:.warning}

## Starter Code

Download the starter code:

```
git clone https://github.com/natalieagus/nslab2.git
```

This will result in a directory with the following structure:

```
nslab2
   |-original_files
      |-longtext.txt
      |-shorttext.txt
      |-SUTD.bmp
      |-triangle.bmp
   |-.gitignore
   |-1_encrypt_text.py
   |-2_encrypt_image.py
   |-3_sign_digest.py
   |-README.md
   |-requirements.txt

```

Then, cd to `nslab2` and install the required modules:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In this lab, you're only required to modify all the 3 python files. You don't need to submit your code, and simply answer the questionnaire on eDimension as usual. There are areas labeled in these `.py` files as `TODO`, and these are your tasks.

## Test the Starter Code

Running the three `.py` files at this point should give you the following printouts stating that you havent implemented the relevant tasks:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nslab2/1.png"  class="center_seventy no-invert"/>

## Debug Notes

### Invalid Syntax

Some of you might encounter the error when running `python3 [starter-code].py`

```python
  match convert_bytes_to_int(read_bytes(client_socket, 8)):
        ^
      case 0:

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

That's because your `python3` <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>is NOT aliased</b></span> to `python3.10` or that you don't have `python3.10` installed. <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Fix this on your own.</b></span> You're a CS major student. Not knowing how to install Python and manage its libraries is _a really really bad thing_; it's like as if the entire 50.002 and the first 6 weeks of CSE doesn't mean anything to you.

In this handout, we assume that `python3` is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>always aliased</b></span> to `python3.10`.
{:.note}

That is, if you type `python3` in the terminal, you'll see at least version 3.10 printed out:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pa2/5.png"  class="center_full no-invert"/>

### Module Not Found

Some of you might encouter the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘cryptography’`. You should know what you need to do by now as a CS student. If you have installed cryptography using `pip install cryptography`, but still suffer from this error, it simply means that the `pip` you used does not install to the path library of whatever `python3` version you are using right now. That is, you may have <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>mixed</b></span> up `Python` and `pip` versions on your machine.

Assuming your `python3` is aliased to `python3.10`, then you can do the following as stated above, instead of `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` you copy pasted from somewhere.

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Submission 
Once you have completed `1_encrypt_text.py, 2_encrypt_image.pym 3_sign_digest.py.py`, zip all files and submit your answer to our bot. Just type `/start` and follow the instruction there. Don't forget to head to eDimension and complete the lab questionnaire as usual.


# Text Encryption

Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>one</b></span> key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt a message. There are many symmetric key encryption algorithms: AES, 3DES, Blowfish, Rivest Cipher 5, etc. For this task, we are going to specifically use a 128-bit AES in CBC mode but we aren't going to build it from scratch. We will be using <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Fernet</b></span>,  a recipe that provides symmetric encryption and authentication to data. It is a part of the `cryptography` library for Python, which is developed by the Python Cryptographic Authority (PYCA).

You can read more about [Fernet's full documentation](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) and its [specs](https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md), but that's out of scope for this lab. We just want to use it as a tool to perform symmetric key encryption.

Open `1_encrypt_text.py` and let's begin. 

## Overview
There are two methods in the file, `enc_text(input_filename, output_filename)` and `dec_text(input_filename, output_filename)`. 

Quickly study what it does.
{:.highlight}

If you scroll below, you'll find these methods called repeteadly to encrypt and decrypt various files:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    enc_text("original_files/shorttext.txt", "output/enc_shorttext.txt")
    dec_text("output/enc_shorttext.txt", "output/dec_shorttext.txt")

    enc_text("original_files/longtext.txt", "output/enc_longtext.txt")
    dec_text("output/enc_longtext.txt", "output/dec_longtext.txt")
```

Our goal is to perform <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>symmetric key encryption</b></span> to plaintext files, and save it as encrypted files (with prefix `enc`). Then, take these encrypted files, decrypt it, and save it back to disk (with prefix `dec`).  

## Key Generation
### Task 1-1 

`TASK 1-1:` Generate a fresh fernet key.
{:.task}

This key is used to both encrypt and decrypt messages. You need to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>keep this safe</b></span> in real applications. Any adversaries that can get access to this key will be able to decrypt all your *supposedly confidential* messages. 

You can use the following method, and print it out to inspect its value. 
```python
symmetric_key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(symmetric_key)
```

## Cipher Instantiation
A <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>cipher</b></span> is name given in general that represents an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption. The *key* above is used as an input to the cipher to perform encryption or decryption.
### Task 1-2 
`TASK 1-2:` Generate a cipher using Fernet (in both `enc` and `dec` functions)
{:.task}

You can take the symmetric key above and generate an instance of `Fernet` to help you `encrypt` and `decrypt` later:
```python
cipher = Fernet(symmetric_key)
```

## Encryption and Decryption
At this stage, encryption and decryption is *trivial*. You can encrypt data (in `bytes`) and decrypt data (in `bytes`) using the following method:
```python
message_bytes = b'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna'
encrypted_message_bytes = cipher.encrypt(message_bytes)
decrypted_message_bytes = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message_bytes)
assert message_bytes == decrypted_message_bytes
```

Now you should be able to complete these two tasks. 

### Task 1-3 
`TASK 1-3:` Encrypt the raw bytes. Fill in your answer under the `TODO` for this task. 
{:.task}

{:.note-title}
> Fernet Token
>
> `encrypted_message_bytes`, known as the *ciphertext* or the Fernet token in this context (as we are using the Fernet protocol in this Python's `cryptography` module), contains a few things in this order:
> * Version: 1 byte
> * Timestamp: 8 bytes
> * IV: 16 bytes (the initialization vector)
> * Ciphertext: Variable length (the actual encrypted data)
> * HMAC: 32 bytes (the message authentication code)

### Task 1-4 
`TASK 1-4:` Decrypt the raw bytes. Fill in your answer under the `TODO` for this task. 
{:.task}


## Creating a Printable Text Using base64
If you attempt to print the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>encrypted</b></span> message bytes directly, you might see some weird characters printed out. That's because they're <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>no longer</b></span> represent any printable <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>encoding</b></span>. 

In `enc_text` function, we provide a way to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>encode</b></span> the encrypted byte into a printable string using the `base64` module, before <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>saving</b></span> it to file. 

```python
   # Convert the ciphertext output to a printable string
   encrypted_base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(encrypted_bytes)
   encrypted_text = encrypted_base64_bytes.decode("utf8")

   # Save the printable string back to file
   with open(output_filename, "w") as fp:
      fp.write(encrypted_text)
```

This way you can open the `enc_[output_filename]` and read the encrypted bytes as proper string. 

As a result, when <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>decrypting</b></span> later on, we need to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>decode</b></span> it back first before performing a decryption. We have done this for you in `dec_text` function:
```python
   # Open the file containing the cyphertext, read as string
   with open(input_filename, "r") as fp:
      encrypted_text = fp.read()

   # Convert the printable string back to bytearray
   encrypted_bytes = base64.b64decode(encrypted_text.encode("utf8"))
```

You may experiment writing the encrypted bytes to the file directly without encoding, and observe the difference.
{:.note}

## Note about Encoding
This section is just for your information as there seems to be rampant misunderstanding that encoding and encryption are both the "same" thing just because they transform data from one format to another. 
{:.info}
<span class="orange-bold">Encoding != Encryption</span>. Encoding schemes and encryption algorithms serve <span class="orange-bold">fundamentally different purposes</span>, even though both involve transforming data from one form to another. The key distinctions lie in their objectives, methods, and the necessity for secrecy.
{:.error}


Encoding is designed to **transform** data into a specific format for efficient transmission or storage, making it convenient to process by computers and human-readable in some cases. Encoding does not aim to keep information secret but ensures that it is represented in a form suitable for various systems or applications. Common examples of encoding include **Base64**, **ASCII**, and **Unicode**.

Encryption, on the other hand, is intended to protect data confidentiality by converting the original information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a secret key. The primary purpose of encryption is to ensure that only authorized parties can access the original information by decrypting the ciphertext using the correct key. Examples of encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

### Encoding Schemes

Encoding schemes are methods used to represent data in specific formats, often for the purposes of data storage, transmission, and interpretation by computers and human operators. Here are examples of common encoding schemes, categorized by their primary use:

**Textual Data Encoding:**
- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):** Uses 7 bits to represent 128 characters, including English letters, digits, and control characters. It's the basis for many other encoding schemes.
- **ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1):** Extends ASCII to 8 bits, adding support for Western European languages by including characters such as ñ, ç, and ß.
- **UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 (Unicode Transformation Formats):** Variable-length encodings that can represent every character in the Unicode character set, accommodating all known characters and symbols from languages around the world.

**Numeric Data Encoding:**
- **Binary:** The most basic form of encoding, representing data in two states, 0 and 1, directly corresponding to the off and on states of a computer's transistors.
- **Hexadecimal (Hex):** Uses base 16, representing numbers using sixteen distinct symbols, 0-9 to represent values zero to nine, and A-F to represent values ten to fifteen.

**Media Data Encoding:**
- **Base64:** Encodes binary data into characters selected from a set of 64, using the letters A-Z, a-z, the numbers 0-9, and characters + and /. It is used to encode binary data in contexts that primarily or solely handle textual data, like embedding images in HTML or email attachments.
- **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions):** An extension of the email protocol that supports sending non-text attachments like audio, video, images, and application programs.

**Data Compression and Archiving:**
- **ZIP:** A file format that supports lossless data compression. A ZIP file may contain one or more files or directories that may have been compressed.
- **GZIP:** A file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression. GZIP is often used in combination with TAR for archiving files.

**Data Integrity and Security:**
- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):** A widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed as a 32-character hexadecimal number. It's used to check the integrity of files.
- **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) family:** Cryptographic hash functions that can generate a hash value (digest), including SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512, differing in their bit length and security level. Used for secure data transmission and digital signatures.

Each of these encoding schemes serves specific purposes, from basic representation of text and numbers to complex data integrity and security. 

Encoding schemes use a <span class="orange-bold">publicly</span> known method for transforming data, while encryption algorithms require a <span class="orange-bold">secret</span> key for both encrypting and decrypting the data. 
{:.important}

# Image Encryption

In this task, we are going to encrypt an <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>image</b></span> with another symmetric key cryptography called the 3-DES. The 3-DES applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>each</b></span> data block.

Data Encryption Standard (DES) <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>was</b></span> a US encryption standard for encrypting electronic data. It makes use of a 56-bit key to encrypt 64-bit blocks of plaintext input through repeated rounds of processing using a specialized function. Note that the DES 56-bit key is <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>no longer considered adequate</b></span> in the face of modern computing.

In 2016, a major security vunerability in DES and 3DES was [revealed](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2183). As a result, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>depcrecated</b></span> DES and 3DES for <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>all</b></span> applications by 2023. It has been <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>replaced</b></span> by AES which is more secure and more robust.
{:.info}

Nevertheless, we are going to experiment using 3-DES for this task and observe how image encryption brings about different issues.

Open `2_encrypt_image.py` and let's begin.

## Overview

There are 5 helper functions in the file, and these are mainly used to read columns of an image as bytes. You may leave these untouched:

```python
image_to_cols(image)
cols_to_image(cols)
col_to_bytes(col, top_down=False)
tuple_to_bytes(x)
bytes_to_col(x, length, top_down=False)
```

The main bulk of your task involves filling up the `TODO` in `enc_img` function. If you scroll down, you will see it being called with various images as input.

### Loading the Image

The image is loaded in `enc_img` as such:

```python
# Load the image
im = Image.open(input_filename)
```

We will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>encrypt</b></span> this image <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>column by column</b></span>.

Yes we can encrypt the whole image as a flattened array, or row by row, but for the sake of this lab we will do it column by column so that we can observe a special output.
{:.note}

### Loading Pixel Values per Column

However, we can't use it directly for our encryption. We need to first convert it to an array of <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>columns</b></span>. As such, this helper function `image_to_cols` is used. This is not a Python class, but here's what `zip` and `*` does:

```python
# arr is a 3 by 2 by 3 matrix (3 rows, 2 columns)
arr = [
         [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)],
         [(7, 8, 9), (10, 11, 12)],
         [(13, 14, 15), (16, 17, 18)],
      ]
cols = list(zip(*arr))
print("cols", cols)
```

The above has the output:

```python
# Note: cols is a 2 by 3 by 3 matrix (each "row" here is a column value of arr)

cols = [
         ((1, 2, 3), (7, 8, 9), (13, 14, 15)),
         ((4, 5, 6), (10, 11, 12), (16, 17, 18)),
       ]
```

The `*` operator in this context **unpacks** the elements of arr and provides them as separate arguments to the zip function like `zip([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)], [(7, 8, 9), (10, 11, 12)], [(13, 14, 15), (16, 17, 18)])`.
{: .info}

### Convert Columns to Bytes

The columns in the image consists of pixel values (tuples of 3 integers, representing RGB values), and we can't encrypt it straight away without converting them to bytes. The helper function `col_to_bytes` and `tuple_to_bytes` already did this for you:

```python
def col_to_bytes(col, top_down=False):
    """
    Helper function to convert each pixel tuple to bytes. Iterate the column top-down or bottom-up
    """
    out = []
    for pixel in col[:: (1, -1)[top_down]]:
        out.insert(0, tuple_to_bytes(pixel))
    return b"".join(out)


def tuple_to_bytes(x):
    """
    Helper function to convert a tuple of integers into bytes
    """
    return int.from_bytes(list(x), byteorder="big").to_bytes(
        3, byteorder="big"
    )
```

In short, if a `pixel` in `col` has the value of `(255, 255, 255)` (RGB), it will be converted into 3 bytes: `b'\xff\xff\xff'`. All pixels in the column will be converted into bytes and joined together, for instance:

```python
cols = [
         ((1, 2, 3), (7, 8, 9), (13, 14, 15)),
         ((4, 5, 6), (10, 11, 12), (16, 17, 18)),
       ]

for col in cols:
    column_bytes = col_to_bytes(col, True)
    print("column_bytes", column_bytes)
```

Has the output:

```python
column_bytes b'\x01\x02\x03\x07\x08\t\r\x0e\x0f'
column_bytes b'\x04\x05\x06\n\x0b\x0c\x10\x11\x12'
```

### Bottom-up vs Top-down

We can load the column bytes bottom-up or top-down. This will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>affect</b></span> our encryption result later on. Consider our example above with image matrix:

```python
arr = [
         [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)],
         [(7, 8, 9), (10, 11, 12)],
         [(13, 14, 15), (16, 17, 18)],
      ]
```

The output above loads the column bytes "top-down", so we have column bytes:

```python
column_bytes b'\x01\x02\x03\x07\x08\t\r\x0e\x0f' # (1,2,3), (7,8,9), (13,14,15) in bytes
column_bytes b'\x04\x05\x06\n\x0b\x0c\x10\x11\x12' # (4,5,6), (10,11,12), (16,17,18) in bytes
```

If we load the column bytes "bottom-up", we will end up with column bytes:

```python
column_bytes b'\r\x0e\x0f\x07\x08\t\x01\x02\x03' # (13,14,15), (7,8,9), (1,2,3) in bytes
column_bytes b'\x10\x11\x12\n\x0b\x0c\x04\x05\x06' # (16,17,18), (10,11,12), (4,5,6) in bytes
```

Notice how the order _within the tuple_ must be preserved, just the way we pack each tuple is different. Don't worry, we have already done these mental gymnastics for you.
{:.note}

## Key Generation

The key in this case is already given to you:

```python
    # Key for 3DES
    key = b"\xb6\x11\xd5\xd7\x83\xb2,m"
```

## Create a Cipher

### Task 2-1

`TASK 2-1:` create a cipher with `TripleDES` using the `key` above.
{:.task}

```py
cipher = Cipher(algorithms.TripleDES(key), mode)
```

The constructor for `Cipher` takes in two arguments:

- The first argument specifies the algorithm to be used and the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>key</b></span>
- The second argument, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>mode</b></span>, specifies how multiple blocks of data are handled by the encryption algorithm. It can be either <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>ECB</b></span> or <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>CBC</b></span> depending on whether the input argument `cbc` to `enc_image` is `True` or `False`.

### ECB Mode

ECB stands for ‘electronic codebook’. When using ECB mode, <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>identical</b></span> input blocks always encrypt to the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>same</b></span> output block.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/ns-lab-2/ecb.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

### CBC Mode

CBC stands for 'cipher block chaining'. In CBC mode, the current block is added to the previous ciphertext block, and then the result is encrypted with the key (thus the word chained). Decryption is thus the reverse process, which involves decrypting the current ciphertext and then adding the previous ciphertext block to the result.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/contentimage/ns-lab-2/cbc.png"  class="center_seventy"/>

{:.note-title}
> Initialization Vectors (IVs)
> 
> IVs are used in encryption to ensure that the same plaintext encrypted with the same key will result in different ciphertexts each time. This randomness is crucial for security in modes like CBC. An IV is generated for **each** encryption operation and is typically included with the ciphertext to be used during decryption.
>
> <span class="orange-bold">They don't have to be secret</span>. The security of encryption does not rely on the secrecy of the IV. Instead, it relies on the secrecy of the symmetric key. The IV's purpose is to introduce randomness to ensure that identical plaintexts do not produce identical ciphertexts.
>
> In protocols like Fernet above, the IV is included with the ciphertext. When decrypting, the IV is extracted from the token and used to decrypt the data.


## Create a CipherContext instance for encryption

### Task 2-2

`TASK 2-2:` Afterwards, create a CipherContext instance from the `encryptor()` method
{:.task}

```python
encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
```

It can be used to encrypt data as such:

```python
raw_bytes = b"abcdefghijklmnop"  # 16 bytes
print("raw_bytes", raw_bytes)
encrypted_bytes = (
    encryptor.update(raw_bytes) + encryptor.finalize()
)  # 16 bytes
print("encrypted_bytes", encrypted_bytes)
```

The output is:

```python
raw_bytes b'abcdefghijklmnop'
encrypted_bytes b'\x12\x96]\x00\x12\x0e\x80C*\x1b\xc7d\xd2\x10=\xeb'
```

Note that if `ECB` mode is used, then the encrypted bytes above will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>always</b></span> be the same.
{:.note}

However, if we change the length of `raw_bytes` into 17 bytes, eg: `b"abcdefghijklmnopq"`, we will be faced with `ValueError: The length of the provided data is not a multiple of the block length.`. What happened?

## Pad Column Bytes

### Task 2-(3,4)

`TASK 2-(3,4):` If you attempt to encrypt your data right away with this, it will fail because 3DES encrypts <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>64 bit blocks</b></span>. It expects the length of the data to be encrypted to be a multiple of 64.
{:.task}

Hence we need to pad it. At first you need to create a padding instance, and use it as such:

```python
padder = padding.PKCS7(64).padder()
test_bytes = b"Lorem" # 5 bytes
padded_test_bytes = padder.update(test_bytes) + padder.finalize() # 8 bytes
print("padded_test_bytes", padded_test_bytes)
```

The output is:

```python
padded_test_bytes b'Lorem\x03\x03\x03'
```

PKCS7 padding is a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>generalization</b></span> of PKCS5 padding (also known as standard padding). PKCS7 padding works by appending N bytes with the value of `chr(N)` (Python built-in function `chr`), where N is the number of bytes required to make the final block of data the same size as the block size.
{:.note}

With this, you should be able to complete Task 2-3 and 2-4.

### Task 2-5

`TASK 2-5:` Encrypt the padded column bytes. Fill in your answer under the `TODO` for this task.
{:.task}


## Observe the Output Images

When you have successfully completed Task 2-1 to 2-5, there will be 8 output images at `output/`. <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Observe them</b></span> and think about the answers to these questions.

Look at all `ECB` outputs.

1. Are there any differences between `top-down` and `bottom-up` output?
2. What kind of <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>security vulnerabilities</b></span> the `ECB` mode has? Will you use this to encrypt your images in real life?

Then look at all `CBC` outputs:

1. Compare the result of `CBC` mode with `ECB` mode, what differences do you see? Is it an _improvement_ (more secure)?
2. Why do you think the outputs have the "smearing" effect?
3. Does it still have some kind of security vulnerabilities?
4. Do we want to prioritise `top-down` or `bottom-up` encryption, or will it depend on the image?

# Message Digest 

In class, we also learned how a signed message digest could be used to guarantee the integrity of a message. Signing the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>digest</b></span> instead of the message itself gives much better <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>efficiency</b></span>.

In the final task, we will create and sign a message digest, and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>verify</b></span> it with the corresponding public key.

Open `3_sign_digest.py` and let's begin.

## Generate RSA Key-Pair

### Task 3-(1,2)

`TASK 3-(1,2):` Before we can sign any digest, we need to first generate the asymmetric key pair. 
{:.task}

```py
private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
    public_exponent=65537,
    key_size=1024,
)

public_key = private_key.public_key()
```

The first argument dictates the value of `e` (the public exponent). Almost everyone uses `65537` (for security purposes) as recommended [here](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/rsa/). The second argument dictates the key size (1024 bits in for this task).

## Using the Keys

Afterwards, we can use the private or public key for encryption or decryption. However, there are some terminologies that you need to know.

### Encrypt and Decrypt

Encryption of a message with a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>public key</b></span> is normally labeled as `encryption` in the API, and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>decryption</b></span> with a private key is labeled as `decryption` (names that you will expect). Here's an example to get you started:

```python
data_bytes = b"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"

encrypted_data_bytes = public_key.encrypt(
    data_bytes,
    padding.OAEP(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        label=None,
    ),
)

decrypted_data_bytes = private_key.decrypt( # 128 bytes long
    encrypted_data_bytes,
    padding.OAEP(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
        label=None,
    ),
)

assert decrypted_data_bytes == data_bytes

print("encrypted_data_bytes", encrypted_data_bytes) # ciphertext
print("decrypted_data_bytes", decrypted_data_bytes) # same as data_bytes
```

Note that for `encrypt` with `public_key`, the length of data bytes depends on the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>padding</b></span> scheme. This example uses [`OAEP`](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-5906-5_150) scheme, but there are other schemes too such as `PKCS1v15`, etc. You can read more about alternative paddings and their parameters [here](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/rsa/#module-cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding).

It is <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>important</b></span> to know how many bytes the padding will add at _minimum_.

- With 1024 RSA-key, the maximum length of message that it can encrypt is also 1024 bits (128 bytes)
- OAEP with `SHA-256` takes 66 bytes of padding overhead, leaving you with only 62 bytes of content to encrypt/decrypt at a time
- You will encounter this as well in Programming Assignment 2

### Sign and Verify

If you want to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>encrypt</b></span> a message using the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>private key</b></span>, the keyword you should look for in the API is `sign`, and the output is commonly called as a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>signature</b></span>:

- Conversely, if you want to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>decrypt</b></span> the output signature, the keyword in the API is `verify`. There will be no output here if the verification succeeds (the decrypted signature matches the initial message), but a `VerficationError` will be raised if otherwise.
- But don't be fooled! Verification _is a decryption_, and signing _is an encryption_. They just have different names that are tied to their _purpose_.

Here's an example to get you started:

```python
data_bytes = b"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna" # 121 bytes

signature = private_key.sign(
    data_bytes,
    padding.PSS(
        mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
        salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH,
    ),
    hashes.SHA256(),  # Algorithm to hash the file_data before signing
)

try:
    public_key.verify(
        signature,
        data_bytes,
        padding.PSS(
            mgf=padding.MGF1(hashes.SHA256()),
            salt_length=padding.PSS.MAX_LENGTH,
        ),
        hashes.SHA256(),
    )
    print("Verification Succeeds")
except:
    print("Verification Fails")
    exit()
```

Note that the length of `data_bytes` can be arbitrarily long because it will be <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>hashed</b></span> automatically (third argument of `sign`) before encrypted with the private key. The <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>output</b></span> length of `SHA-256` is 32 bytes only (256 bits) which when added with the padding, will still be less than 128 bytes.

We also use a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>different</b></span> padding scheme for the signature (`PSS`) and not `OAEP` because of the _nature_ of the padding. You may read more about it [here](https://www.cryptosys.net/pki/manpki/pki_rsaschemes.html) or in any other online source materials but it is our of our syllabus.

### Salting in Hashing

{:.info}
A salt is a random value added to the input (e.g., a password) before hashing.

It ensures that the same input will produce **different** hash outputs. This prevents attackers from using precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) to reverse-engineer the hashed values.

Characteristics of Salt:
* **Uniqueness**: Each input (e.g., each password) should have a unique salt to prevent identical inputs from producing the same hash.
* **Randomness**: The salt should be randomly generated to ensure unpredictability.
* Non-**Secret**: The salt does <span class="orange-bold">not</span> need to be kept secret. It is typically stored **alongside** the hash in a database. From Lab 3 (TOCTOU), you have seen how salt is kept alongside the hashed password in `/etc/shadow` file. 

## Creating a Digest

### Task 3-(3,4)

`TASK 3-(3,4):` In order to create a message digest, you must first create a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>hash</b></span> instance, then use it with `update(input)` and `finalize()` methods.
{:.task}

```python
data_bytes = b"Lorem Ipsum" # 11 bytes

hash_function = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())

hash_function.update(data_bytes)
message_digest_bytes = hash_function.finalize() # 32 bytes
print("message_digest_bytes", message_digest_bytes)
```

The print output is:

```sh
message_digest_bytes b'\x03\r\xc1\xf96\xc3AZ\xff?3W\x165\x15\x19\r4z(\xe7X\xe1\xf7\x17\xd1{\xaeE5A\xc9'
```

{:.highlight-title}
> Question
> 
> Is the length of `message_digest_bytes` always the same (32 bytes), regardless of the length of the input `data_bytes`?

### Task 3-(5-8)

`TASK 3-(5-8):` With all the explanations above, you should be able to complete these tasks. Fill in your answer under the `TODO` for this task.
{:.task}

## Summary

Finally, if you scroll below you will find these four function calls:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    enc_digest("original_files/shorttext.txt")
    enc_digest("original_files/longtext.txt")
    sign_digest("original_files/shorttext.txt")
    sign_digest("original_files/longtext.txt")
```

Here we test encryption of digest using public key (`enc_digest`) and encryption of digest using private key (`sign_digest`), and we test each with two files of differing length. Study its output carefully and head to edimension to answer the rest of the questionnaires.
