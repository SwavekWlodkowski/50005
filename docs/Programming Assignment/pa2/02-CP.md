# The Confidentiality Protocol
{: .no_toc}

<span style="color:#f77729;"><b>Congratulations!</b></span> ðŸŽ‰, you can now be assured that you are uploading your file to the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>right</b></span> destination and not a fake, malicious server.

However, can you trust the network *path* used for your upload?

- It may go through many <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>intermediate</b></span> routers and communication links that you donâ€™t know very well (or not at all).
- Could people tap the links and <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>steal</b></span> your data?

Unfortunately, <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>yes</b></span>. Malicious parties can eavesdrop on your conversation with the server. Although _sometimes_ confidentiality is not an issue, it is obviously not the case when you're uploading _personal_ files to a remote server.

To avoid the theft of data in transmission, you should implement a confidentiality protocol (CP). There are two basic ways to do this:

1. Confidentiality Protocol 1: Using <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>public</b></span> key cryptography
2. Confidentiality Protocol 2: Using <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>symmetric</b></span> key cryptography

{:.note}
We have summarised some important functionality from Python Cryptography. [You can read them all here](https://natalieagus.github.io/50005/pa2/py-crypto) as you're this assignment. 

# Confidentiality Protocol 1 (CP1)

## Task 2 (2%)

{:.task}
`TASK 2:` Design a protocol to protect the confidentiality of the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>content</b></span> of the uploaded file using <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>public key</b></span> cryptography. For simplicity, the filename does <span class="orange-bold">not</span> have to be encrypted.


The suggested steps are as follows:

1. The client <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>encrypts</b></span> the file data (in units of <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>byte</b></span> blocks) before sending, and SecureStore <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>decrypts</b></span> on receive.
2. Since the RSA key size is 1024 bits, it can encrypt/decrypt at most 128 bytes of data at a time.
   - However you will need to use a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>padding</b></span> for the data blocks and padding + data blocks must be 128 bytes at maximum.
   - There are two options:
     - `PKCS1v15`: min 11 bytes of padding, max 117 bytes data blocks
     - `OAEP` with `MGF` and `SHA-256`: min 66 bytes of padding, max 62 bytes data blocks
   - During checkoff, **inform us** which padding option you used for the assignment. <span class="orange-bold">Please stick to just one for the entire assignment</span>.

Since you were able to implement AP, you already have everything you need for CP1. Just remember that in public key cryptography, we could use <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>either</b></span> the public or private key for the encryption!


{:.highlight-title}
> Which key to use? 
> 
> Figure out <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>which key</b></span> to use to encrypt the data from the Client to securely upload your files to the server while protecting the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>confidentiality</b></span> of the file.

## Expanding the FTP for CP1

Make a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>copy</b></span> of Task 1 files: `ClientWithSecurityAP.py` and `ClientWithSecurityAP.py` each, and name it as `ClientWithSecurityCP1.py` and `ServerWithSecurityCP1.py`.

Leave the original files as is. You should have 6 `.py` files now under `source/`. There's no need to implement any new `MODE` in this task.
{:.note}

Here's a recap of the `MODE` for CP1:

- `0`: client will send `M1`: size of filename, and `M2`: the filename (no need to modify, don't need to encrypt this)
- `1`: client will send `M1`: size of data block in `M2`, and `M2`: <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>encrypted</b></span> blocks of data to the server. The server has to decrypt it before writing the file to `source/recv_files/` (NEW for Task 2)
  > Note: It is up to you to <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>either</b></span> concatenate ALL encrypted bytes and send it all at once as `M2` with the appropriate `M1` value (total encrypted bytes) _or_ to send chunks of 128 bytes at repeatedly, e.g: send `M1`: 128 (as bytes), then `M2`: encrypted data chunk, repeatedly until the entire encrypted files are sent. The latter requires lots of socket `send` function calls, but it's your call. We have accounted for either cases in our grading scheme.
  - No matter which method you choose, both are still _under_ `MODE 1`, which means to send the file _data_ in its entirety.
  - <span class="orange-bold">Do not repeatedly send `MODE 1` for every 128-bytes chunk.</span>
- `2`: client closes connection (no need to modify, same as original)
- `3`: client begins authentication protocol as per Task 1 (no need to modify, same as AP in Task 1)

And here's a little diagram to help you in your implementation. Remember, the little <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>vulnerability</b></span> highlighted in the AP section is still illustrated here.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pa2/6.png"  class="center_full"/>


### Grading

We will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>manually</b></span> check the implementation of your `MODE 1` in both Client and Server scripts.

### Commit Task 2

Save your changes and commit the changes (assuming your current working directory is the project root):

```sh
git add source/ServerWithSecurityCP1.py source/ClientWithSecurityCP1.py
git commit -m "feat: Complete Task 2"
```

# Confidentiality Protocol 2 (CP2)

## Task 3 (2%)

{:.task}
`TASK 3:` Design a protocol to protect the confidentiality of the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>content</b></span> of the uploaded file using <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>symmetric key</b></span> cryptography.

Although CP1 is easy to implement, it is unbearably <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>slow</b></span>. Try using it on a large file (>100MB, e.g `cmos.mp4`) and observe its slowdown relative to no encryption (no confidentiality).

Hence, you will also implement this <span class="orange-bold">alternate</span> confidentiality protocol that we call CP2:

- CP2 negotiates a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>shared session key</b></span> (symmetric key) between the client and server, and
- Uses the session key to provide <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>confidentiality</b></span> of the file data thereafter.

{:.info-title}
> Key Generation
> 
> You <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>should</b></span> use [`Fernet`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) to generate the session keys. Fernet is a symmetric key encryption system based on AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key for encryption with PCKS7 padding. It is part of Python `cryptography` module). Recall that symmetric key encryption is <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>much</b></span> faster than RSA.

{:.highlight-title}
> Question 
> 
> Before you proceed, you might want to ask yourself: <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>who</b></span> should generate the session key? Client or server?

## Expanding the FTP for CP2

Make a <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>copy</b></span> of Task 2 files: `ClientWithSecurityCP1.py` and `ServerWithSecurityCP1.py` each, and name it as `ClientWithSecurityCP2.py` and `ServerWithSecurityCP2.py`.

Leave the original files as is. You should have 8 `.py` files now under `/pa2`.
{:.note}

Now both client and server must implement `MODE: 4`, which signifies the `key generation` handshake.

1. Upon successful AP, client must then generate a session key using `Fernet`, then send `MODE: 4`, (`int` converted to `bytes`) to the server, followed by two messages:
   - `M1`: size of `M2` in bytes
   - `M2`: generated <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>session key bytes</b></span> that is encrypted (by what key? Remember we want to protect the confidentiality of this session key -- so only our server can decrypt it).
2. Then the client proceed to prompt the user with filename as per the regular FTP.
3. Upon receiving `MODE: 4`, the server must receive and decrypt the session key.

It goes without saying that `MODE: 1` implementation must be modified for both Server and Client to utilise the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>session key</b></span> instead.
{:.important}

Here's a recap of the `MODE` for CP2:

- `0`: client will send `M1`: size of filename, and `M2`: the filename (no need to modify, don't need to encrypt this)
- `1`: client will send `M1`: size of data block in `M2`, and `M2`: <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>encrypted</b></span> blocks of data using the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>session key</b></span>. The server has to decrypt it with the <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>session key</b></span> as well before writing it to file (NEW for Task 3)
- `2`: client closes connection (no need to modify, same as original)
- `3`: client begins authentication protocol as per Task 1 (no need to modify, same as AP in Task 1)
- `4`: client begins sharing of session key protocol (NEW for Task 3)

And here's a little diagram to help you in your implementation. Remember, the little <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>vulnerability</b></span> highlighted in the AP section is still illustrated here.
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pa2/7.png"  class="center_full"/>

### Grading

We will <span style="color:#f77729;"><b>manually</b></span> check the implementation of your `MODE 1` and `MODE 4` in both Client and Server scripts.

### Commit Task 3

Save your changes and commit the changes (assuming your current working directory is the project root):

```sh
git add source/ServerWithSecurityCP2.py source/ClientWithSecurityCP2.py
git commit -m "feat: Complete Task 3"
```

By the end of Task 3, you have 1 server-client script pairs for each task (8 scripts in total under `source/`): the original (non-secure), AP, CP1, and CP2 pairs.
