## 50.005 NS Roadmap

Here's a Roadmap for you to help you get through tough times in **the second half** of the course. **Blue** nodes are **clickable** and will direct you to the relevant lecture note section. **Yellow** nodes are also clickable and will bring you to the relevant lecture notes.

This map is inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). Give the site a visit, tons of amazing roadmaps in there!
