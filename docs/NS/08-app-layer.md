{: .no_toc}

{:.info}
The application layer is the <span class="orange-bold">topmost</span> layer in the 5-layer OSI Model of computer networking. It is responsible for **providing** network services **directly to end-users or applications**. The application layer serves as the <span class="orange-bold">interface</span> between the user (or user applications) and the network, ensuring that communication between software applications on different devices is possible.
